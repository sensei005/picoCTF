This is the "Challenge.zip" zip file that we have.
thus we'll use the "wget" command to download it first.

cmd --> wget challenge.zip from artifacts.picoctf.net/c_titan/139

We'll unzip it now.

CMD --> challenge.zip unzip

We discovered a directory called "drop-in" after unzipping it.
We received a file with the name "message.txt" after accessing the directory.

CMD --> message.txt for cat

The flag was received by picoCTF{s@n1t1z3_be3dd3da}.
