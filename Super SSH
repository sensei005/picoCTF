We'll use "SSH" to connect in to the terminal using the user "ctf-palyer" and the password "6abf4a82" at port "49226".

cmd --> ssh -p 49226 ctf-player@titan.picoctf.net

It will then prompt you for a password. Put "6abf4a82" as the password now.

Thus, the flag picoCTF{s3cur3_c0nn3ct10n_65a7a106} was obtained.
