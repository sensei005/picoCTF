First, we will use the wget command to download the zip file.

CMD --> wget https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/9689f2b453ad5daeb73ca7534e4d1521/

We will unzip the file after downloading it.

cmd --> unzip Addadshashanammu.zip

We will now explore the directories in more detail.

cmd -> cd Addadshashanammu/Almurbalarammi/Assurnabitashpi/Ashalmimilkala/Maelkashishi/Onnissiralis/Ularradallaku

Once we navigate to the "Ularradallaku" directory, we observe that the file "fang-of-haynekhtnamet" is present.

We'll see what it contains.

cmd --> cat fang-of-haynekhtnamet

When we open it, the following flag appears: picoCTF{l3v3l_up!_t4k3_4_r35t!_2bcfb2ab}
