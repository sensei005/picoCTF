At first we will make a directory and store the two files in the same directory

cmd --> wget https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/14/level2.py
cmd --> wget https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/14/level2.flag.txt.enc

Then we will run the python file
After running the file we can see that its asking for a password
So to get the password we will open the python file

cmd --> vim level2.py

On checking the command we see that the password is fragmented.
So we will use python to concatenate it

cmd --> 1) python
        2) >>> chr(0x34) + chr(x65) + chr(0x63) + chr(0x39)

We get the password --> 4ec9

Now again after running the python file "level2.py" and putting the password that we got "4ec9"

We get our flag

picoCTF{tr45h_51ng1ng_9701e681}
