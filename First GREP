First, we will use the "wget" command to get the strings file.

cmd --> wget https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/static/495d43ee4a2b9f345a4307d053b4d88d/file


Subsequently, we will extract human-readable text strings from the file using the "strings" tool.

cmd --> strings file

We can now verify that we have obtained every string from the file. Thus, we will use the "grep" program to determine the specific string.

cmd --> strings file | grep pico

Thus, we were given the flag.
