We shall first start the instance.
Following that, the "netcat" command is shown.


cmd --> nc saturn.picoctf.net 64387

The output we are receiving is fragmented.

Thus, we will now concatenate it using Python.

cmd --> Python

Next, we'll make use of the netcat command's scattered output.

cmd --> >>> 'picoCTF{gl17ch_m3_n07_' + chr(0x61) + chr(0x34) + chr(0x33) + chr(0x39) + chr(0x32) + chr(0x64) + chr(0x32) + chr(0x65) + '}'

Thus, the flag is obtained.

picoCTF{gl17ch_m3_n07_a4392d2e}
