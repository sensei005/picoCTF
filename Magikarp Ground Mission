Here we will login via SSH in terminal
So, start by lauching instance.
After Launching instance we will get "Challenge endpoints"

cmd --> ssh ctf-player@venus.picoctf.net -p 59139

After that it will ask if you want to continue. Type "yes".
Now it will ask for the password "a13b7f9d"
After loggin in type "ls" to list the directory.

Now we are going to see there are 2 txt files, "1of3.flag.txt" and "instructions-to-2of3.txt"
Start by seeing the contents of the files

cmd --> cat 1of3.flag.txt

We will get to see that 1of3 file has content "picoCTF{xxsh_"

Now, type "cd .." to go to the previous directory and list its content, type "ls"
we wiil see that there is a file named "3of3.flag.txt"

cmd --> cat 3of3.flag.txt

It contains "71be5264}"

Now again go to the previous directory by typing "cd .."
We will get a directory named "ctf-player"

Now again go to the previous directory by typing "cd .."
We will see another txt file named "2of3.flag.txt"
List the content

cmd --> cat 2of3.flag.txt

we will get "0ut_0f_\/\/4t3r_"


Now, we have got all parts of the flag --> picoCTF{xxsh_0ut_0f_\/\/4t3r_71be5264}
