We'll use SSH to log in to the terminal here.
Thus, launch the instance first.

Following instance launch, "Challenge endpoints" will be sent.

cmd --> ssh venus.picoctf.net -p 59139 ctf-player

It will then ask you if you wish to proceed. Enter "yes."
This time, the password "a13b7f9d" will be requested.
Type "ls" to list the directory after logging in.

Currently, we will observe that there are two text files: "instructions-to-2of3.txt" and "1of3.flag.txt".
Look at the files' contents first.

cmd --> flag.txt /cat 1of3.

We will observe that "picoCTF{xxsh_" is the content of 1of3 files.

To view the contents of the previous directory, type "ls" after typing "cd.." We will notice that a file called "3of3.flag.txt" is present.

cat 3of3.flag.txt; command

There is "71be5264}" in it.

Enter "cd.." to return to the previous directory.
A directory called "ctf-player" will be obtained.

Enter "cd.." to return to the previous directory.
Another text file called "2of3.flag.txt" will be visible.
Enumerate the contents

cmd --> cat 2of3.flag.txt

"0ut_0f_\/\/4t3r_" is what we shall receive.


We now possess every component of the flag --> picoCTF{xxsh_0ut_0f_\/\/4t3r_71be5264}
