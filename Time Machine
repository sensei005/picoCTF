First, we will use the "wget" command to download the zip file.

cmd --> wget https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c_titan/163/challenge.zip

We will unzip the zip file after downloading it.

cmd --> unzip challenge.zip

It is evident that a directory called "drop-in" exists.

We now enter the directory and make a list of its contents.

cmd -- > ls -al

As we can see, the file has the ".git" extension now.

Thus, we will use the "reflog" tool to view the changes in Git.

cmdÂ --> git reflog

As a result, picoCTF{t1m3m@ch1n3_88c35e3b} was generated.
